# Ozobot Hands-On Experiments - Teacher Guide

### ‚ö° Getting Started
**Description:** Turn on and get it moving

#### Content:

## Turn On Your Ozobot

Press and hold the small button on top for 2 seconds until it lights up.

It will flash different colors - this is calibration. When it stops flashing, it's ready.

## First Activity: Just Get It Moving

Take one piece of paper. Draw a simple black line with your marker. Put the Ozobot on the line.

**That's it. Watch what happens.**

## If It's Not Working

- Try turning it off and on again
- Make sure it's on white paper
- Use the flat side of the marker for thick lines
- Ask for help

### üìù Drawing Basic Tracks
**Description:** Making paths for robots to follow

#### Content:

## Line Drawing Basics

- **Black marker only** for basic paths
- **Thick lines** - use the flat side of the marker
- **Smooth curves** - sharp corners confuse them
- **White paper works best**

## Simple Track Ideas

- **Straight line** - easiest start
- **Circle** - robot goes around forever
- **Square** - around the edges of paper
- **Wavy line** - like a snake
- **Figure-8** - if you're feeling ambitious

**The robot has tiny cameras underneath that follow the dark line.**

### üåà Color Codes - Make It Do Tricks
**Description:** Adding commands to your tracks

#### Content:

## How Color Codes Work

Draw colored squares ON your black line. The robot reads them like commands.

**Basic pattern:** Black line ‚Üí colored squares ‚Üí black line

## Easy Speed Codes to Try

**RED-GREEN-RED** = Goes really fast (TURBO)

**BLUE-BLACK-BLUE** = Goes fast

**RED-BLACK-RED** = Goes slow

**GREEN-BLACK-GREEN** = Normal speed

## Rules for Color Codes

- Colors must touch each other
- Same width as your line
- Put them on straight parts, not curves

### üîÑ Direction Tricks
**Description:** Making robots turn around and do moves

#### Content:

## Turn Around Code

**BLUE-RED-BLUE** = Robot stops, turns around, goes back

**BLUE-RED** = Same thing but at the end of a line

## Try This: Ping Pong Effect

Draw a straight line. Put turn-around codes at both ends. Robot bounces back and forth.

## Cool Move Codes

**GREEN-RED-GREEN-RED** = SPIN (spins around twice)

**RED-GREEN-RED-GREEN** = TORNADO (spins around 4 times, getting faster)

**BLUE-BLACK-GREEN-RED** = ZIGZAG (sways left-right-left-right while moving)

### üéØ Working Together Ideas
**Description:** Group activities and challenges

#### Content:

## Hamster Wheel Tracks

Take a piece of paper. Draw a circle. Tape the ends together to make a tube. Robot goes around and around.

## Class Track Challenge

We can draw one big track together on the whiteboard or tape papers together.

Kids can add their own color codes where they think the robot needs to speed up or slow down.

## Overlay Your Own Codes

If there are tight curves on a shared track, you can place small colored paper squares on top to help your robot navigate.

## Experiment Ideas

- Race two robots with different speed codes
- See what happens with multiple codes in a row
- Try putting codes in different places
- Make the longest track possible

**Remember: We're all figuring this out together. Try things and see what happens.**

### üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
**Description:** When things go wrong

#### Content:

## Robot Not Following Line?

- Check if line is thick enough
- Make sure paper is white
- Try recalibrating (turn off/on)
- Check lighting in room

## Robot Flying Off Track?

- Slow it down before curves
- Make curves more gradual
- Check if color codes are too close to turns

## Color Codes Not Working?

- Make sure colors touch each other
- Check that squares are same width as line
- Try making them slightly bigger

## General Tips

- Start simple, add complexity
- Test one change at a time  
- It's okay if it doesn't work - that's how we learn
- Ask classmates what worked for them
