# TONIGHT'S MICRO:BIT PLAN - Ready for 7:40am Tomorrow

## CRISIS SOLVED
- **Problem:** Bluetooth transmitters delayed until Thursday, drones need access codes, Spheros need phones
- **Solution:** 45 micro:bits work via USB cable, no batteries needed
- **Classes:** STEM = pixel art/names, Creative Coding = reaction games

## WHAT WORKS RIGHT NOW
- Tested: makecode.microbit.org loads, blocks work, download/drag process works
- 45 micro:bits available, max class size 33 
- USB powered (no battery issues)
- Students stay at computers (structured, no chaos)

## TONIGHT'S TASKS

### 1. Rewrite Both Lessons with EXPLICIT 6th-Grade Steps
**Current Problem:** Instructions like "hint: use string block" won't work
**Solution Needed:** "Step 1: Click Basic section. Step 2: Drag 'show string' block. Step 3: Click where it says 'Hello!' and type YOUR NAME"

### 2. Complete Presentation Architecture  
**Process:**
1. Rewrite teacher-guide.md files with step-by-step instructions
2. Copy presentation.html, simple-styles.css, simple-presentation.js from existing project
3. Git workflow: add → commit → push → ./sync-teacher.bat
4. Test presentations are live before bed

## LESSON ASSIGNMENTS
- **STEM:** Scrolling names → Pixel art → Animated art (creative/artistic focus)
- **Creative Coding:** Button controls → Reaction time game → Multi-level games (programming logic focus)

## KEY INSIGHT
Need McDonald's-level instructions: "Press the red button labeled 'Download'" not "Download your code"

## FILES CREATED
- `/03-work/teacher/05-microbit-stem-art/teacher-guide.md` (needs rewrite)
- `/03-work/teacher/06-microbit-creative-coding-games/teacher-guide.md` (needs creation)

## BACKUP PLAN
If presentations aren't ready: Live demo makecode.microbit.org on projector, but kids will get off-task quickly without structured challenges.

## SUCCESS METRIC
Students complete structured challenges instead of trying to play Minecraft after 5 minutes.
