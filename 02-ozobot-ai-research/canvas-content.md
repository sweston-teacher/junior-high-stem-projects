### ðŸ¤– Ozobot AI Research Assignment

**Your Mission:** Use SchoolAI to become the class expert on Ozobots! You'll research these amazing little robots and create a document that shows what you've learned.

#### Research Categories (All Required)
Your research document must include information about:

1. **What is an Ozobot?** - Basic definition and what makes it special
2. **How do Ozobots work?** - Technology and how they move/make decisions  
3. **Ozobot Programming** - How to control them, what are color codes?
4. **Cool Things Ozobots Can Do** - At least 3 specific examples
5. **Ozobots in Education** - How they're used in schools and what they teach
6. **Your Questions** - 2-3 things YOU want to know, with answers from SchoolAI

#### Step-by-Step Process:
1. **Login to SchoolAI** using your school credentials
2. **Research each category** by asking specific questions
3. **Copy key information** (not entire responses - just the important parts!)
4. **Ask follow-up questions** when you need clarification
5. **Open Notepad** and organize your research
6. **Save your file** on desktop as "YourName_Ozobot_Research.txt"
7. **Submit here** by copying and pasting your organized research

#### Document Format:
```
[Your Name]'s Ozobot Research
STEM Class - [Today's Date]

1. WHAT IS AN OZOBOT?
