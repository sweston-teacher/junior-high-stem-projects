# STEM 02: Ozobot AI Research Project - Teacher Overview

## Project Purpose & Goals
**Primary Goal:** Students learn to use AI as a research tool while exploring robotics concepts through hands-on investigation of Ozobots

**Learning Objectives:**
- Master AI research skills using SchoolAI as a learning tool
- Build on copy/paste and text file skills from clock project
- Introduction to robotics concepts and programming logic
- Information literacy: identifying and organizing key information
- Digital workflow: research → document → submit
- Prepare for hands-on Ozobot activities in future lessons

**Practical Benefits:**
- Students learn to use AI effectively for learning (not just homework)
- Self-directed research builds independence and confidence
- Foundation knowledge for upcoming Ozobot programming activities

## Target Classes
- **STEM Class** (main implementation)
- Both classes benefit from AI literacy and robotics introduction

## Final Assessment Criteria (Proficiency-Based)
**4 - Highly Proficient:** Complete research document with all sections, clear organization, submitted on time

**3 - Proficient:** Research document with most sections complete, good information quality

**2 - Approaching Proficient:** Research document created but missing some sections or unclear organization

**1 - Below Proficient:** Incomplete or not submitted

## Project Workflow Philosophy
- **AI as learning amplifier** - Use AI to explore topics faster and deeper
- **Research literacy** - Teach students HOW to ask good questions
- **Building on success** - Uses copy/paste and file skills from clock project
- **Preparation for action** - Research leads to hands-on Ozobot activities

## Key Learning Outcomes
### AI Research Skills
- How to prompt AI effectively for learning
- Identifying reliable vs unreliable AI responses
- Asking follow-up questions for deeper understanding
- Using AI as a starting point, not final authority

### Information Management Skills
- Organizing research into clear categories
- Copy/paste with purpose (not just copying everything)
- Creating coherent documents from multiple sources
- File management and submission workflows

### Robotics Foundation Knowledge
- Understanding what robots are and how they work
- Introduction to programming concepts through Ozobot
- Color coding and visual programming concepts
- Real-world applications of robotics

## Student Context & Accommodations
- **AI Experience:** Most have never used AI - need clear guidance
- **Research Skills:** Phone-based searching, need structure for deeper research
- **Copy/Paste:** Building on clock project skills
- **Attention Management:** AI can provide instant gratification but need focus on learning

## Why This Works Pedagogically
1. **Authentic Skill:** AI research is becoming essential for all learning
2. **Scaffolded Learning:** Builds directly on clock project file skills
3. **Student Agency:** They control their learning through questions they ask
4. **Immediate Application:** Research directly prepares for hands-on Ozobot work
5. **Future-Ready:** Teaches responsible AI use for education
6. **Differentiation Built-In:** Students can go as deep as their curiosity takes them

## Cross-Curricular Connections
- **English:** Research writing, information organization, questioning skills
- **Science:** Scientific inquiry, robotics, technology systems
- **Math:** Programming logic, sequencing, problem-solving
- **Social Studies:** Technology impact on society, ethical AI use

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Fast Finishers:** Research advanced Ozobot programming, help peers with questions
- **Struggling Students:** Provide specific question templates, buddy system
- **Visual Learners:** Encourage finding images and videos through AI prompts
- **Different Learning Styles:** AI can provide information in multiple formats

## Teacher Benefits
- **Models AI Use:** Shows students responsible AI integration in education
- **Low Prep:** Students generate their own content through research
- **Formative Assessment:** See what students understand about robotics concepts
- **Engagement:** Students love exploring with AI when given structure
- **Scalable:** Works for both STEM and Creative Coding contexts

## Technical Requirements
- **Software:** SchoolAI access, Notepad (text file creation), Canvas
- **Hardware:** Standard school computers with internet
- **Network:** Internet required for SchoolAI access
- **Accounts:** Students need SchoolAI login credentials
