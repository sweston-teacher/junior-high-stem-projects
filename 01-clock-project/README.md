# STEM 01: Personal Desktop Clock Project - Teacher Overview

## Project Purpose & Goals
**Primary Goal:** Students learn essential digital literacy skills including file management, and get hands-on introduction to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by creating a dynamic web-based clock

**Learning Objectives:**
- Master basic computer file skills (save as, file types, desktop organization)
- Introduction to web technologies (HTML structure, CSS styling, JavaScript functionality)
- Copy/paste operations and following technical instructions
- Web design principles and user interface customization
- Create a practical tool that displays time, class periods, time remaining, and visual progress indicators
- Build a flexible system that accommodates complex scheduling (assemblies, lunch variations)

**Practical Benefit:** Students develop independence with time management by creating their own reference tool

## Target Classes
- **STEM Class** (main implementation)
- **Creative Coding Class** (same project, coding focus)
- Both classes benefit from this practical tool

## Final Assessment Criteria (Proficiency-Based)
**4 - Highly Proficient:** HTML file saved, bookmarked, all challenges completed

**3 - Proficient:** HTML file saved and bookmarked  

**2 - Approaching Proficient:** HTML file saved

**1 - Below Proficient:** HTML file not saved

## Project Workflow Philosophy
- **Get OUT of Canvas fast** - minimal Canvas dependency after Day 1
- **Real file skills** - no downloads, they create files manually
- **Self-contained learning** - instructions embedded in code comments
- **Practical result** - tool they actually use daily

## Key Learning Outcomes
### Digital Literacy Skills
- Copy/paste operations
- Save As functionality with file type selection
- Basic file management (desktop organization)
- Browser bookmark management
- Understanding file extensions (.html)

### Coding Concepts (Gentle Introduction)
- HTML structure (skeleton of websites)
- CSS styling (decoration/appearance)
- JavaScript functionality (behavior/interactivity)
- Comments as documentation
- Code modification vs creation

### Problem-Solving Skills
- Following step-by-step instructions
- Finding specific text in code (Ctrl+F)
- Trial and error with colors
- Troubleshooting file saves

## Student Context & Accommodations
- **Typing Level:** Two-finger "plink plunk" style
- **Computer Literacy:** Phone-focused, limited desktop experience
- **Arrow Keys:** Many don't know they exist or move cursor
- **Attention Span:** Need engaging, visual feedback

## Why This Works Pedagogically
1. **Authentic Learning:** Creates a real tool they will actually use daily
2. **Immediate Feedback:** Visual changes provide instant validation of their work
3. **Scaffolded Complexity:** Progresses from simple copy/paste to code modification
4. **Student Ownership:** Personalized with their name and color choices
5. **Real-World Skills:** File management and web technologies are essential 21st-century competencies
6. **Cross-Curricular:** Integrates technology, math (time/percentages), and problem-solving

## Cross-Curricular Connections
- **Math:** Time calculations, percentages, digital vs analog
- **Art:** Color theory, design principles
- **English:** Following instructions, technical vocabulary
- **Life Skills:** Time management, organization, technology literacy

## Differentiation Strategies
- **Fast Finishers:** Explore additional CSS properties, help peers
- **Struggling Students:** Buddy system, focus on core challenges only
- **Visual Learners:** Color picker provides immediate visual feedback
- **Kinesthetic:** Hands-on file creation and bookmark management

## Teacher Benefits
- **Authentic Assessment:** Students create functional, real-world applications
- **Standards Alignment:** Covers multiple USBE Creative Coding and STEM Concepts standards
- **Student Independence:** Students develop self-management skills
- **Scalable Implementation:** Works for both STEM and Creative Coding classes
- **Low Maintenance:** Self-contained project with embedded instructions
- **Professional Development:** Demonstrates innovative, technology-integrated pedagogy

## Technical Requirements
- **Software:** Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac), any web browser
- **Hardware:** Standard school computers
- **Network:** None required after initial code copy from Canvas
- **Storage:** Local desktop saves (no cloud dependency)
