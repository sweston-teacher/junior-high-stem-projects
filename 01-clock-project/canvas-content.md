## Assignment Title
**Personal Desktop Clock - Create Your Own Time Management Tool**

## Assignment Description (Copy/Paste into Canvas)

<h1>🕐 Personal Desktop Clock Project</h1>

<h2>Your Mission</h2>
<p>Create your personal desktop clock that shows the current time, class periods, and time remaining - with your name and custom colors!</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Get the Code</h3>
<ul>
<li>📝 <strong>Open Notepad</strong> (search for it in your start menu)</li>
<li>📋 <strong>Copy the HTML code</strong> from below</li>
<li>📄 <strong>Paste it into Notepad</strong> (Ctrl+V)</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Save Your File</h3>
<ul>
<li>💾 <strong>Save as "clock.html" on your desktop</strong></li>
<li>Click File → Save As</li>
<li><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Change "Save as type" to "All Files" (not Text Document)</li>
<li>Type: clock.html</li>
<li>Save location: Desktop</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. See It Work!</h3>
<p>🌐 <strong>Double-click clock.html on your desktop</strong> - you'll see a working clock in your browser!</p>

<h3>4. Edit Your Code</h3>
<ul>
<li>📝 <strong>Go back to Notepad</strong> to edit the code</li>
<li>🔍 <strong>Use Ctrl+F to find "CHALLENGE 1"</strong> in the code</li>
<li>✏️ <strong>Make the change described in the challenge</strong></li>
<li>💾 <strong>Save the file in Notepad</strong> (Ctrl+S)</li>
<li>🔄 <strong>Go back to your browser and refresh</strong> (F5) - you'll see your change!</li>
<li>🔁 <strong>Repeat for all 9 challenges</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Use the Color Picker</h3>
<ul>
<li>🎨 <strong>Use the color picker on your clock</strong> to test colors, then copy the hex codes into your challenges</li>
<li>🔖 <strong>When finished, bookmark your clock</strong> so you can use it every day</li>
</ul>

<h2>Understanding the Edit-Save-Refresh Process</h2>
<p>This is something most of you have never done before:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Edit</strong> the code in Notepad</li>
<li><strong>Save</strong> the file (Ctrl+S)</li>
<li><strong>Refresh</strong> the browser (F5) to see changes</li>
</ol>
<p>You're editing the SAME file in two different programs - Notepad shows the code, browser shows the result.</p>

<h2>The 9 Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li>🏷️ <strong>Challenge 1:</strong> Change browser tab title to include your name</li>
<li>🎨 <strong>Challenge 2:</strong> Customize background color</li>
<li>🎨 <strong>Challenge 3:</strong> Customize time box color</li>
<li>🎨 <strong>Challenge 4:</strong> Customize status box color</li>
<li>🎨 <strong>Challenge 5:</strong> Customize controls box color</li>
<li>🎨 <strong>Challenge 6:</strong> Customize progress box color</li>
<li>🎨 <strong>Challenge 7:</strong> Customize progress bar color</li>
<li>📝 <strong>Challenge 8:</strong> Change page title to include your name</li>
<li>🙈 <strong>Challenge 9:</strong> Hide color picker when done</li>
</ul>

<h2>Success Looks Like</h2>
<p>A working clock with your name in the title, your chosen colors, and a bookmark that opens your personal clock instantly!</p>
