## Assignment Title
**Personal Desktop Clock - Create Your Own Time Management Tool**

## Assignment Description (Copy/Paste into Canvas)

<h1>🕐 Personal Desktop Clock Project</h1>

<h2>Your Mission</h2>
<p>Create your personal desktop clock that shows the current time, class periods, and time remaining - with your name and custom colors!</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<h3>1. Get the Code</h3>
<ul>
<li>📝 <strong>Open Notepad</strong> (click the Windows button in bottom-left corner, then search for "notepad")</li>
<li>📋 <strong>Copy the HTML code from below:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Click at the very beginning of the code</li>
    <li>Hold down your mouse button and drag to the very end</li>
    <li>All the code should be highlighted blue</li>
    <li>Right-click on the highlighted code and choose "Copy" OR press Ctrl+C</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>📄 <strong>Paste it into Notepad:</strong> Click in Notepad and press Ctrl+V</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Save Your File</h3>
<ul>
<li>💾 <strong>Save as "clock.html" on your desktop</strong></li>
<li>Click File → Save As</li>
<li>In the Save window, look for "Desktop" on the left side and click it</li>
<li><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Look for a dropdown that says "Text Documents" and change it to "All Files"</li>
<li>In the filename box, type: clock.html</li>
<li>Click Save</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. See It Work!</h3>
<p>🌐 <strong>Double-click clock.html on your desktop</strong> - you'll see a working clock in your web browser!</p>

<h3>4. Edit Your Code</h3>
<ul>
<li>📝 <strong>Go back to Notepad:</strong> Click on the Notepad icon in your taskbar (the bar at the bottom of your screen)</li>
<li>🔍 <strong>Find "CHALLENGE 1":</strong> Scroll through the code and look for stars (⭐⭐⭐) and "CHALLENGE 1"</li>
<li>✏️ <strong>Make the change described in the challenge</strong></li>
<li>💾 <strong>Save the file in Notepad</strong> (Ctrl+S)</li>
<li>🔄 <strong>Go back to your web browser and refresh</strong> (F5) - you'll see your change!</li>
<li>🔁 <strong>Repeat for all 9 challenges</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Use the Color Picker</h3>
<ul>
<li>🎨 <strong>Use the color picker on your clock</strong> to test colors, then copy the hex codes (color numbers like #FF0000) into your challenges</li>
<li>🔖 <strong>When finished, bookmark your clock:</strong> Click the star icon next to the address bar, then click "Done"</li>
</ul>

<h2>Understanding the Edit-Save-Refresh Process</h2>
<p>This is something most of you have never done before:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Edit</strong> the code in Notepad</li>
<li><strong>Save</strong> the file (Ctrl+S)</li>
<li><strong>Refresh</strong> the web browser (F5) to see changes</li>
</ol>
<p>You're editing the SAME file in two different programs - Notepad shows the code (the instructions), and the web browser reads those instructions and shows you the pretty result.</p>

<h2>The 9 Challenges</h2>
<ul>
<li>🏷️ <strong>Challenge 1:</strong> Change browser tab title to include your name</li>
<li>🎨 <strong>Challenge 2:</strong> Customize background color</li>
<li>🎨 <strong>Challenge 3:</strong> Customize time box color</li>
<li>🎨 <strong>Challenge 4:</strong> Customize status box color</li>
<li>🎨 <strong>Challenge 5:</strong> Customize controls box color</li>
<li>🎨 <strong>Challenge 6:</strong> Customize progress box color</li>
<li>🎨 <strong>Challenge 7:</strong> Customize progress bar color</li>
<li>📝 <strong>Challenge 8:</strong> Change page title to include your name</li>
<li>🙈 <strong>Challenge 9:</strong> Hide color picker when done</li>
</ul>

<h2>Success Looks Like</h2>
<p>A working clock with your name in the title, your chosen colors, and a bookmark that opens your personal clock instantly!</p>
