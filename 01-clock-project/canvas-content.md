## Assignment Title
**Personal Desktop Clock - Create Your Own Time Management Tool**

## Assignment Description (Copy/Paste into Canvas)

```markdown
# 🕐 Personal Desktop Clock Project

## Your Mission
Create your personal desktop clock that shows the current time, class periods, and time remaining - with your name and custom colors!

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Get the Code
📝 **Open Notepad** (search for it in your start menu)

📋 **Copy the HTML code** from below

📄 **Paste it into Notepad** (Ctrl+V)

### 2. Save Your File
💾 **Save as "clock.html" on your desktop**
- Click File → Save As
- **IMPORTANT:** Change "Save as type" to "All Files" (not Text Document)
- Type: clock.html
- Save location: Desktop

### 3. See It Work!
🌐 **Double-click clock.html on your desktop** - you'll see a working clock in your browser!

### 4. Edit Your Code
📝 **Go back to Notepad** to edit the code

🔍 **Use Ctrl+F to find "CHALLENGE 1"** in the code

✏️ **Make the change described in the challenge**

💾 **Save the file in Notepad** (Ctrl+S)

🔄 **Go back to your browser and refresh** (F5) - you'll see your change!

🔁 **Repeat for all 9 challenges**

### 5. Use the Color Picker
🎨 **Use the color picker on your clock** to test colors, then copy the hex codes into your challenges

🔖 **When finished, bookmark your clock** so you can use it every day

## Understanding the Edit-Save-Refresh Process
This is something most of you have never done before:
1. **Edit** the code in Notepad
2. **Save** the file (Ctrl+S)
3. **Refresh** the browser (F5) to see changes

You're editing the SAME file in two different programs - Notepad shows the code, browser shows the result.

## The 9 Challenges
🏷️ **Challenge 1:** Change browser tab title to include your name

🎨 **Challenge 2:** Customize background color

🎨 **Challenge 3:** Customize time box color

🎨 **Challenge 4:** Customize status box color

🎨 **Challenge 5:** Customize controls box color

🎨 **Challenge 6:** Customize progress box color

🎨 **Challenge 7:** Customize progress bar color

📝 **Challenge 8:** Change page title to include your name

🙈 **Challenge 9:** Hide color picker when done

## Success Looks Like
A working clock with your name in the title, your chosen colors, and a bookmark that opens your personal clock instantly!
