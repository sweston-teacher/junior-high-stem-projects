# Teacher Guide - STEM Clock Project

## Canvas Discussion Starters (Copy/Paste Ready)
**Use these in any order based on where your class is - no fixed timeline!**
**Copy any of these into Canvas Discussion:**

### Foundation Skills: "Copy, Paste & Save Basics"
```
💻 Computer Skills Check 💻

Today we're going to use "Copy" and "Paste" a lot. 

Explain what you think happens when you "copy" something on a computer. Where does it go? What's the difference between "copy" and "cut"? 

Also, when you save a file, what's the difference between "Save" and "Save As"?

Use your own words - make your best guesses! Type for 5 minutes.
```

### Building Understanding: "File Types & Extensions"
```
📁 File Detective Challenge 📁

Look at your desktop or any folder on this computer. Find 3 different files and write down their full names (including the letters after the dot).

Examples: essay.docx, photo.jpg, song.mp3, webpage.html

What do you think those letters after the dot tell the computer? Why do you think different files have different endings?

Make your best detective guesses for 5 minutes!
```

---

### Personalization: "Making It Yours"
```
🎨 Personalization & Customization 🎨

Today we're changing "YOUR NAME" in the code to your actual name and picking custom colors.

Explain WHY you think personalizing projects is important. How does putting your name on something change how you feel about it? 

Also, why do you think we let you pick your own colors instead of everyone having the same colors?

Take 5 minutes to think about ownership and creativity!
```

---

### Reflection: "Skills Transfer"
```
🚀 Future Skills 🚀

This week you learned: saving files, copying/pasting code, customizing colors, bookmarking websites.

Pick ONE of these skills and explain how you could use it in a completely different class (English, Math, Science, History, etc.). Be specific about what you'd do.

Take 5 minutes to make a real connection!
```

---

### Problem Solving: "When Things Go Wrong"
```
🔧 Troubleshooting Practice 🔧

Think of a time when technology didn't work for you (phone, computer, game, app - anything). 

What was wrong? What did you try to fix it? Did it work? 

Now imagine your HTML file won't open in the browser. Based on your past experience with fixing tech problems, what are 3 things you would try?

Spend 5 minutes thinking like a tech detective!
```

---

### Web Concepts: "Websites Everywhere"
```
🌐 Website Analysis 🌐

Pick any website you visit regularly (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Google, school website, etc.).

Describe 3 specific things about how it looks that make it easy or hard to use. Think about colors, text size, where buttons are placed, etc.

Remember: someone coded every single thing you see! Take 5 minutes to really look at design choices.

## Presentation Raw Materials (Copy/Paste Ready)

### File Management Basics
```
Slide Title: File Management Basics

Definition:
File Extension
The letters after the dot in a filename (.html, .jpg, .docx)
Tells the computer what type of file it is

Why File Extensions Matter:
• Computer needs to know how to open the file
• Different programs handle different file types
• .html files open in web browsers
• .docx files open in Word

Call to Action:
Challenge: Find 3 files with different extensions
```

### Copy, Cut, and Paste Superpowers
```
Slide Title: Copy, Cut, and Paste Superpowers

Definitions:
Copy (Ctrl+C) - Makes a duplicate - original stays, copy goes to clipboard
Cut (Ctrl+X) - Moves something - removes original, puts it on clipboard  
Paste (Ctrl+V) - Takes whatever is on clipboard and puts it somewhere new

Copy/Paste is Essential Because:
• Saves time and prevents mistakes
• Works across all programs
• Fundamental computer skill
• You'll use it in every class

Call to Action:
Try This: Copy some text and paste it somewhere else
```

### Save vs Save As
```
Slide Title: Save vs Save As

Definitions:
Save (Ctrl+S) - Saves your work
First time = asks where to put it and what to name it
After that = just saves changes

Save As - Always asks where to put it and what to name it
Use when you want to make a copy with a different name

Save vs Save As:
• Save = first time asks for name/location, then just saves changes
• Save As = always asks for name/location  
• Both work for new projects
• Save As is useful for making copies

Call to Action:
Your Turn: Save your HTML file to the desktop
```

### Finding Things with Ctrl+F
```
Slide Title: Finding Things with Ctrl+F

Definition:
Find (Ctrl+F) - Searches for specific words in your document
Essential for finding things in code

Ctrl+F (Find) is a Superpower:
• Quickly locate specific words
• Essential for finding challenges in code
• Works in almost every program
• Saves tons of scrolling time
```

### What is HTML?
```
Slide Title: What is HTML?

Definition:
HTML - HyperText Markup Language
The structure/skeleton of every webpage

HTML is Everywhere:
