## 🕐 Project Overview: Personal Desktop Clock

### What You're Building This Week
You will create your own personalized desktop clock that shows:
- ✅ Current time and date
- ✅ What class period you're in
- ✅ How much time is left in class
- ✅ Your name and custom colors

### The Big Idea
By Friday, you will have built something you'll actually use every day. No more asking "What time is it?" - you'll have your own personal clock!

### Skills You'll Learn
- 💾 File management (save, save as, file types)
- 📋 Copy and paste basics
- 🔍 Finding things with Ctrl+F
- 🌐 Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- 🎨 Customization and design thinking

### Real-World Connection
Every website you've ever visited uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By the end of this week, you'll understand the building blocks of the entire internet!

## 📋 Assignment Instructions

### Your Mission
Create your personal desktop clock that shows the current time, class periods, and time remaining - with your name and custom colors!

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Get the Code
- 📝 **Open Notepad:** Click the Windows button in bottom-left corner, then search for "notepad"
- 📋 **Copy the HTML code from Canvas:**
  - Click at the very beginning of the code
  - Hold down your mouse button and drag to the very end
  - All the code should be highlighted blue
  - Right-click on the highlighted code and choose "Copy" OR press Ctrl+C
- 📄 **Paste it into Notepad:** Click in Notepad and press Ctrl+V

#### 2. Save Your File
- 💾 **Save as "clock.html" on your desktop:**
  - Click File → Save As
  - In the Save window, look for "Desktop" on the left side and click it
  - **IMPORTANT:** Look for a dropdown that says "Text Documents" and change it to "All Files"
  - In the filename box, type: clock.html
  - Click Save

#### 3. See It Work!
- 🌐 **Double-click clock.html on your desktop** - you'll see a working clock in your web browser!

#### 4. Edit Your Code
- 📝 **Go back to Notepad:** Click on the Notepad icon in your taskbar (the bar at the bottom of your screen)
- 🔍 **Find "CHALLENGE 1":** Scroll through the code and look for stars (⭐⭐⭐) and "CHALLENGE 1"
- ✏️ **Make the change described in the challenge**
- 💾 **Save the file in Notepad** (Ctrl+S)
- 🔄 **Go back to your web browser and refresh** (F5) - you'll see your change!
- 🔁 **Repeat for all 9 challenges**

#### 5. Use the Color Picker
- 🎨 **Use the color picker on your clock** to test colors, then copy the hex codes (color numbers like #FF0000) into your challenges
- 🔖 **When finished, bookmark your clock:** Click the star icon next to the address bar, then click "Done"

### Understanding the Edit-Save-Refresh Process
This is something most students have never done before:
1. **Edit** the code in Notepad
2. **Save** the file (Ctrl+S)
3. **Refresh** the web browser (F5) to see changes

You're editing the SAME file in two different programs - Notepad shows the code (the instructions), and the web browser reads those instructions and shows you the pretty result.

## 💾 File Management Basics

### File Extension
The letters after the dot in a filename (.html, .jpg, .docx). Tells the computer what type of file it is.

### Why File Extensions Matter
- Computer needs to know how to open the file
- Different programs handle different file types
- .html files open in web browsers
- .docx files open in Word

### Try This
Challenge: Find 3 files with different extensions on your computer

---

## 📋 Copy, Cut, and Paste Superpowers

### Definitions
- **Copy (Ctrl+C):** Makes a duplicate - original stays, copy goes to clipboard
- **Cut (Ctrl+X):** Moves something - removes original, puts it on clipboard  
- **Paste (Ctrl+V):** Takes whatever is on clipboard and puts it somewhere new

### Copy/Paste is Essential Because
- Saves time and prevents mistakes
- Works across all programs
- Fundamental computer skill
- You'll use it in every class

### Try This
Copy some text and paste it somewhere else

---

## 💾 Save vs Save As

### Save (Ctrl+S)
- Saves your work
- First time = asks where to put it and what to name it
- After that = just saves changes

### Save As
- Always asks where to put it and what to name it
- Use when you want to make a copy with a different name

### Your Turn
Save your HTML file to the desktop

---

## 🔍 Finding Things with Ctrl+F

### Find (Ctrl+F)
Searches for specific words in your document. Essential for finding things in code.

### Ctrl+F (Find) is a Superpower
- Quickly locate specific words
- Essential for finding challenges in code
- Works in almost every program
- Saves tons of scrolling time

---

## 🌐 What is HTML?

### HTML
**HyperText Markup Language** - The structure/skeleton of every webpage. It tells the browser what goes where.

### HTML is Everywhere
- 🌐 Every website you've ever seen
- 📱 Your phone apps use similar code
- 📺 Social media, games, school websites
- 😊 Not as hard as it looks!

### Think About It
Right now you're looking at HTML! This webpage, TikTok, YouTube, Google - all built with HTML. You're about to join millions of people who know how to create for the web.

---

## 🎨 CSS: Making Things Look Good

### CSS
**Cascading Style Sheets** - Controls how websites look (colors, fonts, layout). Like decorating your room!

### Hex Code
A way to specify exact colors using numbers/letters. Example: #FF0000 = red

### Why CSS Matters
- 🎨 Makes websites beautiful instead of boring
- 🌈 Controls colors, fonts, and layout
- 📱 Makes sites work on phones and computers
- ✨ Brings your creative vision to life

### Practice Time
Change one color in your code using the color picker. Watch how CSS instantly transforms your clock!

---

## ✨ Personalizing Your Code

### Why We Customize
- 🏠 Makes it yours
- 🎯 Increases engagement
- 🧠 Teaches design thinking
- ⚡ Shows cause and effect

### Your Goal
Bookmark your finished clock so you can use it every day. This isn't just a school project - it's a tool you'll actually use!

### The Psychology of Ownership
When you put your name on something and make it your own, you care more about it. That's why we're not just copying code - we're creating something personal that reflects who you are.

---

### Reflection: "Skills Transfer"
```
🚀 Future Skills 🚀

This week you learned: saving files, copying/pasting code, customizing colors, bookmarking websites.

Pick ONE of these skills and explain how you could use it in a completely different class (English, Math, Science, History, etc.). Be specific about what you'd do.

Take 5 minutes to make a real connection!
```

### Problem Solving: "When Things Go Wrong"
```
🔧 Troubleshooting Practice 🔧

Think of a time when technology didn't work for you (phone, computer, game, app - anything). 

What was wrong? What did you try to fix it? Did it work? 

Now imagine your HTML file won't open in the browser. Based on your past experience with fixing tech problems, what are 3 things you would try?

Spend 5 minutes thinking like a tech detective!
```

---

### Web Concepts: "Websites Everywhere"
```
🌐 Website Analysis 🌐

Pick any website you visit regularly (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Google, school website, etc.).

Describe 3 specific things about how it looks that make it easy or hard to use. Think about colors, text size, where buttons are placed, etc.

Remember: someone coded every single thing you see! Take 5 minutes to really look at design choices.
