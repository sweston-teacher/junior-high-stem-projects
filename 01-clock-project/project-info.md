# STEM 01: Clock Project

## Project Overview
Personal Desktop Clock Website for junior high STEM class

**Goal:** HTML file on desktop showing time, time remaining, basic design options

**Learning Objectives:**
- Basic computer skills: copy/paste, save/save as, file types
- Intro to code structure (guided discovery)
- Digital clock functionality
- Schedule integration
- Basic logic concepts
- Practical tool they'll actually use

**Structure:** Teacher does heavy lifting on code, students do guided copy/paste with explanations

**Justification:** Counts as STEM (computer use in STEM fields) + addresses real digital literacy gaps

## Student Context
- Students type with two fingers (plink plunk style)
- Don't know F1-F12 keys exist
- Don't know arrow keys move cursor
- Only familiar with phone interfaces
- Many can't read analog clocks (two clocks in room, still ask for time)
- Constantly ask "what time is it" and "how much time left"

## TODO
- [ ] Get clock code totally finished with Grok
- [ ] Plan week of STEM clock activities (after code is finished)
- [ ] Enter final lesson plan into Canvas

## Development Notes
*Working with Grok to get finished code, then working backwards to plan activities*
