### File Management Basics
**Description:** Saving files and understanding extensions

#### Content:
## 📁 File Management Basics

### File Extension
The letters after the dot in a filename (.html, .jpg, .docx). These tell the computer what type of file it is and which program should open it.

### Why File Extensions Matter
- 💻 Computer needs to know how to open the file
- 📄 Different programs handle different file types
- 🌐 .html files open in web browsers
- 📝 .docx files open in Word

### Try This: File Detective Challenge
Look at your desktop or any folder. Find 3 different files and write down their full names (including the letters after the dot). What do you think those letters tell the computer?

### Teaching Tips
- Show examples on your computer
- Let students explore their own files
- Explain that this is like labeling boxes
- Connect to apps on their phones

### Copy, Cut, and Paste
**Description:** Essential computer skills

#### Content:
## ✂️ Copy, Cut, and Paste Superpowers

### The Big Three
**Copy (Ctrl+C):** Makes a duplicate - original stays, copy goes to clipboard
**Cut (Ctrl+X):** Moves something - removes original, puts it on clipboard
**Paste (Ctrl+V):** Takes whatever is on clipboard and puts it somewhere new

### Why This is Essential
- ⚡ Saves time and prevents mistakes
- 🔄 Works across all programs
- 🎯 Fundamental computer skill
- 📚 You'll use it in every class

### Try This Right Now
Copy some text from this slide and paste it into a new document. Notice how the original text stays here!

### Real-World Uses
- 📝 Moving quotes in essays
- 🔗 Sharing links with friends
- 📊 Copying data between spreadsheets
- 💻 Any computer-based homework

### Save vs Save As
**Description:** When to use each command

#### Content:
## 💾 Save vs Save As

### Save (Ctrl+S)
Saves your work. First time asks where to put it and what to name it. After that, just saves changes to the same file.

### Save As
Always asks where to put it and what to name it. Use when you want to make a copy with a different name.

### When to Use Each
- 💾 **Save:** First time asks for name/location, then just saves changes
- 📁 **Save As:** Always asks for name/location
- ✅ Both work for new projects
- 📄 Save As is useful for making copies

### Your Turn
We're about to save your HTML file to the desktop. Remember: choose "All Files" as the file type, not "Text Document"!

### Pro Tips
- Save early and save often
- Use Save As to make backup copies
- Pay attention to file types
- Organize files in folders

---

### Finding with Ctrl+F
**Description:** Searching for text in documents

#### Content:

### Personalizing Your Code
**Description:** Making the project your own

#### Content:
## ✨ Personalizing Your Code

### Why We Customize
- 🏠 Makes it yours
- 🎯 Increases engagement
- 🧠 Teaches design thinking
- ⚡ Shows cause and effect

### Your Goal
Bookmark your finished clock so you can use it every day. This isn't just a school project - it's a tool you'll actually use!

### Design Thinking Questions
- ❓ What colors make you feel focused?
- ❓ How do you want others to see your work?
- ❓ What would make this more useful to you?
- ❓ How does color affect your mood?

### The Psychology of Ownership
When you put your name on something and make it your own, you care more about it. That's why we're not just copying code - we're creating something personal that reflects who you are.

---

Today we're going to use "Copy" and "Paste" a lot. 

Explain what you think happens when you "copy" something on a computer. Where does it go? What's the difference between "copy" and "cut"? 

Also, when you save a file, what's the difference between "Save" and "Save As"?

Use your own words - make your best guesses! Type for 5 minutes.
```

---

### Building Understanding: "File Types & Extensions"
```
📁 File Detective Challenge 📁

Look at your desktop or any folder on this computer. Find 3 different files and write down their full names (including the letters after the dot).

Examples: essay.docx, photo.jpg, song.mp3, webpage.html

What do you think those letters after the dot tell the computer? Why do you think different files have different endings?

Make your best detective guesses for 5 minutes!
```

---

### Personalization: "Making It Yours"
```
🎨 Personalization & Customization 🎨

Today we're changing "YOUR NAME" in the code to your actual name and picking custom colors.

Explain WHY you think personalizing projects is important. How does putting your name on something change how you feel about it? 

Also, why do you think we let you pick your own colors instead of everyone having the same colors?

Take 5 minutes to think about ownership and creativity!
```

---

### Reflection: "Skills Transfer"
```
🚀 Future Skills 🚀

This week you learned: saving files, copying/pasting code, customizing colors, bookmarking websites.

Pick ONE of these skills and explain how you could use it in a completely different class (English, Math, Science, History, etc.). Be specific about what you'd do.

Take 5 minutes to make a real connection!
```

---

### Problem Solving: "When Things Go Wrong"
```
🔧 Troubleshooting Practice 🔧

Think of a time when technology didn't work for you (phone, computer, game, app - anything). 

What was wrong? What did you try to fix it? Did it work? 

Now imagine your HTML file won't open in the browser. Based on your past experience with fixing tech problems, what are 3 things you would try?

Spend 5 minutes thinking like a tech detective!
```

---

### Web Concepts: "Websites Everywhere"
```
🌐 Website Analysis 🌐

Pick any website you visit regularly (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Google, school website, etc.).

Describe 3 specific things about how it looks that make it easy or hard to use. Think about colors, text size, where buttons are placed, etc.

Remember: someone coded every single thing you see! Take 5 minutes to really look at design choices.
```
