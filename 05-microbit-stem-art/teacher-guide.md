### STEM Activity - LED Pattern Creator
**Description:** Independent work activity for STEM classes
#### Content:
**Your Mission:** Create a program that shows different LED patterns

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**
1. **Start Your Pattern:** Drag "show icon" from Basic menu into "forever" loop
2. **Pick Your First Icon:** Click the icon box and choose (heart, happy face, sad face, etc.)
3. **Add Wait Time:** Drag "pause (ms)" block from Basic menu, put it under your icon
4. **Set the Time:** Click the number and change it to 1000 (that's 1 second)
5. **Add More Icons:** Repeat steps 1-4 to add 2 more different icons
6. **Test It:** Click the play button in the simulator - you should see your icons change every second

**Challenge Level 1 - Temperature Display:**
7. **Get Temperature Block:** Go to Input menu, drag "temperature (°C)" block
8. **Show the Number:** Drag "show number" from Basic menu into "forever" loop
9. **Connect Them:** Drag the temperature block into the circle of "show number"
10. **What Happens:** Now your micro:bit shows the room temperature in numbers! Try breathing on it to make the number go up.

**Challenge Level 2 - Light Sensor:**
11. **Get Light Block:** Go to Input menu, drag "light level" block  
12. **Show the Light:** Drag another "show number" block into "forever"
13. **Connect Them:** Put the light level block into "show number"
