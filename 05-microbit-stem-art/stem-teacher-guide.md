### STEM Activity - LED Pattern Creator
**Your Mission:** Create a program that shows different LED patterns

**Requirements:**
- Use the "show icon" block to display at least 3 different icons
- Use the "pause" block between each icon
- Make your pattern repeat forever
- Try temperature or light sensor blocks for extra challenge

**Getting Started:**
1. Drag "show icon" from Basic menu
2. Choose your first icon
3. Add a pause block (try 1000 milliseconds)
4. Repeat for more icons
5. Test in simulator, then download to your micro:bit!
